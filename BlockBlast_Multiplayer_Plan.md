# BlockBlast Development Plan

## Current Status
~~**Note:** Multiplayer functionality has been temporarily removed to focus on making the single-player experience solid. Multiplayer will be reimplemented in a future update.~~

**Update:** Multiplayer functionality has been reimplemented using Socket.IO for real-time gameplay.

## Game Overview
BlockBlast is a puzzle game played on an 8x8 grid where players:
- Receive 3 random pieces at a time
- Place pieces anywhere on the board
- Clear lines (horizontal, vertical) to score points
- Score extra points for multiple line clears and combos
- Continue playing until no more valid moves remain

## Project Structure

### Frontend (NextJS)
- [x] Create Next.js project with TypeScript
- [x] Set up game board UI (8x8 grid)
- [x] Implement piece designs and rendering
- [x] Create piece selection/placement interface
- [x] Implement game logic (line clearing, scoring)
- [x] Design lobby/waiting room UI ~~(pending multiplayer reimplementation)~~
- [x] Add multiplayer status indicators ~~(pending multiplayer reimplementation)~~

### Backend (Node.js + Socket.IO)
- [x] Set up Node.js server ~~(pending multiplayer reimplementation)~~
- [x] Implement Socket.IO for real-time communication ~~(pending multiplayer reimplementation)~~
- [x] Create game state management ~~(pending multiplayer reimplementation)~~
- [x] Build matchmaking system ~~(pending multiplayer reimplementation)~~
- [x] Implement game rooms functionality ~~(pending multiplayer reimplementation)~~
- [x] Add player session handling ~~(pending multiplayer reimplementation)~~

## Core Game Features

### Single Player Mechanics
- [x] Generate random pieces (I, T, L, square, etc.)
- [x] Allow piece placement on the board
- [x] Implement line clearing logic
- [x] Calculate scoring (higher points for multiple lines)
- [x] Detect game over conditions
- [x] Add basic animations and effects
- [x] Fix hydration mismatch errors for client-side rendering
- [x] Fix vertical line clears highlighting
- [x] Fix board compaction issues
- [x] Store and display personal best score with localStorage
- [x] Implement combo system for chaining line clears
- [x] Add ability to view final board layout after game over

### Multiplayer Features ~~(Temporarily Removed)~~
- [x] Real-time board updates via Socket.IO
- [x] Player vs player matchmaking
- [x] Game rooms with unique IDs
- [x] Spectator mode
- [x] Competitive scoring system
- [x] Player timeouts and reconnection handling

## Multiplayer Architecture ~~(Future Implementation)~~

### Socket.IO Implementation
- [x] Socket connection management
- [x] Event handling for:
  - [x] Player joins/leaves
  - [x] Piece placement
  - [x] Line clears
  - [x] Game over conditions
  - [ ] Chat messages (optional)

### Game Rooms
- [x] Create/join/leave room functionality
- [x] Room state synchronization
- [x] Handle multiple concurrent games
- [x] Implement room lifecycle (creation, active, completed)

### Player Interaction
- [x] Competitive mode: Same pieces, race to highest score
- [ ] Sabotage elements: Line clears send obstacles to opponent (optional)
- [x] Real-time score comparison
- [x] Victory/defeat conditions

## UI/UX Design
- [x] Main menu and game mode selection
- [x] In-game UI (score, next pieces)
- [x] Score display with personal best tracker
- [x] Combo multiplier display and animations
- [x] Game over screen with final board view option
- [x] Responsive design for multiple device types
- [x] Visual feedback for actions
- [ ] Sound effects and background music (optional)

## Game Enhancements Implemented
- [x] Drag and drop piece placement
- [x] Preview of line clears before piece placement
- [x] Combo scoring system for consecutive line clears
- [x] Personal best score tracking with localStorage
- [x] Fixed grid sizing to prevent board compaction
- [x] Responsive design for different screen sizes
- [x] Client-side only initialization to prevent hydration issues
- [x] Option to view final board layout after game over

## Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Unit tests for game logic
- [ ] Integration tests for multiplayer functionality ~~(future)~~
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Deployment to hosting platform
- [ ] Setup continuous integration

## Stretch Goals
- [ ] Leaderboard system
- [ ] User accounts and profiles
- [ ] Tutorial mode
- [ ] Advanced customization (board themes, piece styles)
- [ ] Mobile app version
- [x] Reimplementation of multiplayer features
